## Application Description
This is a website where you can keep track of all the places you've been. 

## The projects objectives were to complete the following (MVP)
Each destination should be an object with multiple properties using Javascript and Object oriented programming, like location, landmarks, time of year, notes, etc. Display those properties when a user clicks on a place's name.
